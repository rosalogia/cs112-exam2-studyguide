# Study Guide for the 2nd Mid-Term of Rutgers 01:198:112 (Data Structures) Spring 2021

This repository contains a study guide for the 2nd CS112 Mid-Term at Rutgers New Brunswick for Spring 2021. The questions
are drawn from the learning objectives listed on the [Data Structures course page](https://ds.cs.rutgers.edu/lectures/)
as well as the practice problems in [this](https://github.com/Likey00/DS-Problems) repository of practice problems put
together by Ishaan Ivaturi.

Disclaimer: solutions to most conceptual problems listed are drawn from course slides or course material in general. If no
solution was available in course materials, I have made an attempt to answer the question on my own. If you feel that
there may be an error in the provided solution to a question or problem, please open an issue as soon as possible, or
email me at [ambika.eshwar@rutgers.edu](ambika.eshwar@rutgers.edu).

## Repository Structure

This repository contains four folders, each of which correspond to topics which collectively account for at least 75% of the exam.
These topics include:

* Special Linked Structures
  * Everything included except for code solutions and unit tests
* Binary Search
  * Under Construction
* Binary Search Trees
  * Everything included except for code solutions and unit tests
* Balanced Search Trees
  * Study Guide without Solutions included

Each folder contains the following contents:

* A study guide for the given topic that **does not include solutions**
  but does include links or references to material in which
  the question may be answered
* A study guide for the given topic that **includes solutions**. You are
  encouraged to view this document only after attempting to answer as many
  questions in the study guide without solutions as possible. Remember that
  taking the time to look up material that helps you answer a question
  is more valuable than looking up the answer immediately!
* If applicable, a Java project folder that includes templates for implementing
  solutions to coding problems found in the study guide. The project comes with
  unit tests that you may run to verify that your code works as expected.
