# Topic 3: Special Linked Structures

## Conceptual Questions

Note: answers to all the questions below can be found in the [lecture slides](https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/eqxrhlv3uxdo1nbutm5jc2l4ntxz5fmz).

1. Describe and illustrate the memory representation (how to make them) and allocation
(how much space they require) when implementing circular and doubly linked lists.

2. See [Programming Problems](#programming-problems).

3. See [Programming Problems](#programming-problems).

4. List the advantages and disadvantages of using circular linked lists and doubly-linked lists.

5. Give at least one application where it is more appropriate to use a circular linked list than it is to use
any other data structure. Justify your choice.

6. Give at least one application where it is more appropriate to use a doubly linked list than it is to use
any other data structure. Justify your choice.

## Programming Problems

**Note**: consider implementing these and other coding problems in the [provided project template](./sls-project/).

2. Implement common methods on circular and doubly linked lists including, but not limited to:
  * Insert
  * Delete
  * Update
  * Traverse

3. Given a problem statement, design, develop, debug, and test a Java program that uses the
appropriate data structure(s).
